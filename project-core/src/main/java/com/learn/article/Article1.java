     * Simplify drug labelling to show benefits clearly
     *
     * Regulators and researchers should give patients and physicians meaningful information to guide decisions.
     * Jonathan J. Darrow
     *
     * Aducanumab, an Alzheimer’s disease treatment, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June
     * this year despite a lack of robust evidence that it actually slows cognitive decline. In protest, three experts
     * quit an advisory panel. Amid all the soul-searching over how FDA approvals should work, something has been largely
     * missing: a clear description of benefits.
     *
     * The FDA (and the relevant community of scholars) knows that most new drugs offer only modest incremental benefit
     * over drugs already available. But although its thorough analyses of submitted clinical-trial data are disclosed,
     * the relevant documents are impenetrable to nearly everyone. Drug labelling should clearly state what effectiveness
     * was demonstrated and how. The metrics should have real-world relevance, such as how a patient feels, functions or survives.
     *
     * The FDA’s statute requires “substantial evidence” of efficacy, but that term is flexible. Clinical trials are
     * increasingly using ‘surrogate end points’, or non-clinical measures that are ‘reasonably likely’ to predict
     * clinical benefit. But one study found that 52% of 65 oncology-drug correlations were not strong (V. Prasad et al. JAMA Intern. Med. 175, 1389–1398; 2015).
     * Aducanumab’s label reports “Amyloid Beta PET Composite SUVR”, a confusing measure that is hard to translate into,
     * for example, a patient’s ability to recognize loved ones. If a trial outcome cannot be reasonably explained in
     * patient-relevant terms, the FDA should reconsider whether that end point is acceptable for drug approval.
     *
     *
     * Show drugs work before selling them
     *
     * There is also no requirement for substantial efficacy, leaving patients guessing at a drug’s therapeutic value.
     * I have scoured FDA documents underlying drug approvals that have been described in lay media as “life-saving”,
     * “dramatically effective” or ”curative”. That is rarely what the evidence demonstrates. In 2021, I identified ten
     * reports by multiple authors, each examining the evidence of benefit of a range of newly approved drugs (J. J. Darrow J. Manag. Care Spec. Pharm. 27, 685–688; 2021).
     * Collectively, these papers concluded that only 2–31% had better than modest benefits over existing treatments.
     * Aducanumab might therefore be an extreme example, but it is hardly alone.
     *
     * The medical community attempted to fix a related labelling problem more than a decade ago. In the 1990s,
     * practitioners protested that drug labelling was so lengthy and complex that they found it difficult to locate
     * crucial information. Now the FDA requires that drug labelling include a half-page box at the top of package inserts,
     * called ‘highlights of prescribing information’. It requires warnings and precautions to be included, as well as dosage
     * and administration, but not, alas, how well the drug actually works.
     *
     * In a report to Congress in 2010, the FDA concluded that clear efficacy labelling in a space-limited box might
     * often be impossible for drugs because medical information is too complex and variable. Unlike me, few patients
     * or physicians can devote full-time efforts to researching a drug’s value and its regulation, and might therefore
     * be tempted to use price as a proxy for value. In my view, meaningful improvement is possible, and the dramatic
     * increase in drug costs means that it is past time to revisit the issue.
     *
     * The few drugs that provide understandable statements of efficacy offer a hint of just how useful such information
     * could be. For example, the FDA labelling for Yasmin (drospirenone/ethinyl oestradiol), a birth-control product,
     * explains that “pregnancy rates in the clinical trials were less than one per 100 woman-years of use”. Sunscreen — regulated
     * in the United States as an over-the-counter drug — bears quantitative benefit information in the form of a single
     * number: sun protection factor, or SPF. Although SPF is not a perfect measure and few people understand how it is calculated,
     * repeated use allows consumers to learn over time what SPF they require to avoid burning.
     *
     *
     * Demand cancer drugs that truly help patients
     *
     * Benefit cannot always be described with a single figure such as SPF or pregnancies per 100 woman-years. But nutrition
     * labels could serve as a model. Their clear columns and uncluttered text show key information, such as calories and vitamin and mineral content, at a glance.
     *
     * Two randomized controlled trials involving 450 people suggested that an analogous drug-facts box could greatly
     * improve patients’ comprehension of drug benefits and risks (L. M. Schwartz et al. Ann. Intern. Med. 150, 516–527; 2009).
     * Without it, 65% of patients overestimated benefits tenfold or more. For instance, most participants not given the facts box
     * thought that the absolute risk reduction in heart attacks from a hypothetical drug was between 6% and 70%, whereas 72% of
     * participants given the drug-fact box correctly perceived the actual value of 0.8%.
     *
     * The European Medicines Agency has acknowledged the need to “provide more information on benefits in understandable
     * terms”, but regulators around the world have been slow to deliver. I think part of the problem is that showcasing
     * limited drug benefits would be awkward for regulators, health-care providers and manufacturers while also dashing
     * patient hopes, however unrealistic. But there is an ethical duty to inform patients of benefits and risks.
     *
     * Clearer labelling could also change drug companies’ incentives. Radical transparency would favour drugs that
     * work best over those approved despite only marginal benefits.
